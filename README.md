# Albedo App
This iOS app is a proof-of-concept for calculating albedo using an iPhone's camera.

## Camera Files
The following files in the project use the AVFoundation framework to create the camera view that
captures the images:
* AlbedoPhotoCaptureDelegate.swift
* CameraPreviewView.swift
* CameraViewController.swift
* CircularLevel.swift

CameraViewController.swift is the most critical file of the project, as it includes the code that
creates the objects required for the camera.

## View Files
The following files are simple classes that correspond to each view controller of the menu walkthrough.
These classes serve only to save the userâ€™s selection for that given screen to the file
PhotoData.swift. This list of classes is ordered by appearance of the view that they correspond to:
* WelcomeViewController.swift
* SkyViewController.swift
* SnowStateViewController.swift
* PatchinessViewController.swift
* GroundCoverViewController.swift
* SnowSurfaceViewController.swift
* RootViewController.swift
* OptionalDataViewController.swift
* DataViewController.swift

All data that is collected as the user makes menu selections as well as the calculated albedo value is
stored in PhotoData.swift.
